              " 'Michael Elijah\\n9 months ago\\nSomething I noticed is that the officers weapons search of Mr.Brooks only involved what seemed like a pat around the waste area and  then ended with the searching of what seems like Mr.Brooks  back pocket. The weapons search didn‚Äôt seem thorough enough to safely conclude that Mr.Brooks did not have any weapons.  A good weapons search would involve searching  from the waste down and or lifting up pant legs and searching the sides of the shoes.  And also searching from the waste up and or lifting up the persons shirt.  And searching all of the pockets as well.  Onto to the actual shooting of Mr.Brooks.  I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôs taser was taken in the first scuffle. But assuming it wasn‚Äôt the taser of the officer which shot at Mr.Brooks ,that would mean he would still have the option to use his own taser. But something else to consider is how many shots was the taser capable of firing ? I‚Äôm talking about individual shots capable of being fired from the taser and not repetitive electric shocks sent from the taser to the already shot taser probes. So how many shots was the taser capable of firing,and was the officer aware of how many shots the taser was capable of firing ? If the taser was only capable of firing one shot,then the matter is a little different. Because if the taser was shot and missed the target ,and the officer still had his taser with him then he could have fired his own taser instead. Something else to consider is were the dangling taser probes still something to be deeply concerned about ? An other thing to consider is that given what seems like not a good enough weapons pat down,the officer could have still have had doubts with regards to whether or not Mr.Brooks had any weapons on him or not. Which would be a another reason for him to have to shoot Mr.Brooks. That little bit of doubt in the weapons search can make for lack of confidence/stability with regards to the officers handling of the whole matter.  A thorough weapons search helps rule out certain matters. It helps in moving forward with more confidence during the investigation. It can help in doing what‚Äôs best for the officer and the person being investigated. \\nRead more\\nREPLY',\n",
